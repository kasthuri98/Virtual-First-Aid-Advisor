If needed, gently press the wound with a clean bandage or cloth. Raise the area until the bleeding stops.\n3. Clean the wound. Rinse the wound with water. Keeping the wound under running water will lower the risk of infection. Wash around the wound with soap. But don't get soap in the wound. And don't use hydrogen peroxide or iodine. Both can irritate wounds. Remove any dirt or debris with tweezers cleaned with alcohol. See a healthcare professional if you can't remove all debris\n4. Put on an antibiotic or petroleum jelly. Put on a thin layer of an antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly to keep the surface moist and help prevent scarring. Ingredients in some antibiotic ointments can cause a mild rash in some people. If you get a rash, stop using the ointment.\n5. Cover the wound. Put on a bandage, rolled gauze or gauze held in place with paper tape. Covering the wound keeps it clean. If you have just a minor scrape or scratch, don't cover it.\n6. Change the covering. Do this at least once a day or whenever the covering becomes wet or dirty.",
      "warning": "See a healthcare professional if you see signs of infection on the skin or near the wound. These include expanding changes in color, increasing pain, drainage, warmth or swelling.\nSee a healthcare professional to get a tetanus shot. A tetanus shot is needed if you haven't had one in the past five years and the wound is deep or dirty."

Bleeding after a fall or an injury to the head or face could mean that you have broken the nose.",
      "first_aid": "1. Sit up and lean forward. Keep the head up. Lean forward so the blood doesn't go down the throat. This could cause you to choke or have an upset stomach.\n2. Gently blow your nose. This will clear any blood clots.\n3. Pinch the nose. Use the thumb and a finger to pinch both nostrils shut. Breathe through the mouth. Keep pinching for 10 to 15 minutes. Pinching puts pressure on the blood vessels and helps stop the blood flow. If the bleeding doesn't stop, pinch the nose again for up to 15 minutes. Don't let go for at least five minutes even to check if the bleeding has stopped. Seek emergency care if the bleeding doesn't stop after the second try.\n4. Prevent another nosebleed. Don't pick or blow the nose. And don't drop the head below the heart or lift anything heavy for many hours. Gently put a saline gel (Ayr), antibiotic ointment (Neosporin) or petroleum jelly (Vaseline) on the inside of the nose. Put most of the salve on the middle part of the nose, also called the septum. Steam, humidifiers or an ice pack across the bridge of the nose also may help.\n5. If you have another nosebleed, try first-aid steps again. This time, spray both sides of the nose with a nasal spray that has oxymetazoline in it (Afrin). Do this after blowing the nose. Then pinch the nose again. Seek medical help if the bleeding does not stop.",
      "warning": "Contact your doctor if:\nYou have nosebleeds often. You may need to have a blood vessel cauterized. \nCautery is a method that burns and seals blood vessels using electric current, silver nitrate or a laser. Also, a care provider might pack the nose with special gauze or an inflatable latex balloon. Both packing methods put pressure on the blood vessel and stop the bleeding.\nYou have nosebleeds and you're taking blood thinners. If you're taking medicines such as aspirin or warfarin (Jantoven), your care team may change the medicine dose.\n\nThink about using a humidifier. Adding more moisture in your home may help relieve nasal bleeding."

If this isn't possible or if the burn is on the face, apply a cool, wet cloth until the pain eases. For a mouth burn from hot food or drink, put a piece of ice in the mouth for a few minutes.\n2. Remove rings or other tight items. Try to do this quickly and gently, before the burned area swells.\n3. Apply lotion. After the burn is cooled, apply a lotion, such as one with aloe vera. This helps prevent drying.\n4. Bandage the burn. Cover the burn with a clean bandage. Wrap it loosely to avoid putting pressure on burned skin. Bandaging keeps air off the area, reduces pain and protects blistered skin.\n5. If needed, take a nonprescription pain reliever, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).",
